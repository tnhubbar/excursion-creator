This app will allow you to create your own personalized excursion. Upon starting you will have the option to sign up with your own personalized username and password, or log in as an already existing user. You can create an excursion and give it a description and assign to it several places. It will prompt you to enter the excursion and some details and then for each excursion you will then enter the places associated with it  and the details of that place.  The excursion itself will be an object and the places will also be objects.
